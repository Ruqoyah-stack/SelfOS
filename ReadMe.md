# SelfOS - The Human Operating System

### Overview
**SelfOS** is a self-awareness and personal growth system that helps people visualize and manage their evolution, just like product managers track product versions.

It reframes personal growth as a process of continuous iteration, where every individual has their own changelog, backlog, and version history.  
Instead of tracking numbers or streaks, SelfOS helps users track **who they’re becoming** - one version at a time.

---

### What SelfOS Does
SelfOS allows users to:
- Reflect on their daily experiences through guided journaling.
- Identify emotional or behavioral “bugs” and “features.”
- Set mindful growth goals and review weekly progress.
- Visualize their personal evolution as version updates (e.g., *Me v2.1*).
- Celebrate progress in a more human, story-driven way.

---

### Why It Matters
In a world obsessed with metrics and output, **inner growth often goes unseen.**  
People measure productivity but rarely track emotional health or self-development.

SelfOS makes growth visible.  
It’s not about being perfect, it’s about **being aware**, iterating on habits, and celebrating small, meaningful changes.

---

### Who It’s For
- Individuals on self-improvement or therapy journeys.
- Product managers and reflective thinkers who value iteration.
- Students or young professionals navigating change.
- Anyone who wants to understand themselves better through mindful tracking.

### Key Features
- **Onboarding as “Version 1.0”** - users define their starting point and goals.

- **Sprint Focus Mode** - weekly focus areas for intentional growth.
